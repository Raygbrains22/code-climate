# CODE CLIMATE

## Description

The CODE CLIMATE is a responsive web application that allows users to check the current weather and a 5-day forecast for multiple cities. Users can search for a city and view relevant weather details including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The application saves search history using local storage, enabling users to revisit previous cities and check the weather with a single click.

This project demonstrates the use of server-side APIs, dynamic HTML/CSS rendering, and persistent data storage via `localStorage`. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, and utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather data.
